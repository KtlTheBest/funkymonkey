# funkymonkey
I hope I won't abandon this one. Toy interpreter written in F#

# How to use it?
I am not an expert in this one and having quite a time with the project. The only hack I know of is to type:
```
dotnet run
```
If you have `dotnet` and `mono` installed on your machine (which can be Linux btw), then it ought to work.

# WIP
The intepreter is young and naive and stupid (just like me), so there are many problems. But we are taking it slow and adding features incrementally. Must I also say, that the writing in F# was amazing so far, even if it is quite exotic. I am still having problems thinking functionally, so if you have any suggestions or hints on how to improve it, please let me know!

Best regards,
